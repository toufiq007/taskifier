# Taskify

Taskify is a task management application built using React. It provides an easy and intuitive interface for users to manage their tasks, allowing them to add new tasks, delete existing ones, and search for tasks based on both their title and priority. 

## Features

- **Add New Task**:  
  Users can add new tasks by specifying a task title and setting a priority level.

- **Delete Task**:  
  Any task can be removed with a simple click on the delete button.

- **Search Tasks by Title**:  
  A search bar allows users to enter keywords and filter tasks that match the given title.

- **Search Tasks by Priority**:  
  Users can also search or filter tasks based on their assigned priority.
